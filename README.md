index.html was refactored for the client's convenience.

The code was reformatted.
Alt tags were added to the image links in the html.
The title of the website was made more descriptive and unique.
The "Search Engine Optimisiation" item in the navbar did not link correctly to the "Search Engine Optimisation" section on the page... this link was fixed by adding the id to the menu item tag.
